                <br>
                    <strong>We just dont care about the taaste.. but also the people behind the beans</strong>
                    <br>
                    Our world class beans are gently roasted and brewed to perfection.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Seasonal brew:</strong>Coffee tastes best when it is freshly roasted and harvested and that's 
                    what we do all year round.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Machines:</strong>We even sell world class machines for the enthusiasts, experts and beginners to enjoy
                    their self brewing experience.

                At Cozy Cup, we want our guests to enjoy every steaming hot cup of coffee, which is why we only focus on high-quality bean mixes. 
                We know that for many people, it's the coffee that gets you out of bed every morning. 
                It can be a cherished habit to drink a cup of coffee with breakfast to prepare the body for a new day.
                We serve coffee only with fresh Arla milk as the great cup of coffee deserves only the best milk.
                Everything we do has an impact on the environment and our planet. 
                We grow our coffee in the best possible way and take responsibility for the entire chain from bean to cup.
